# Transliteration 

This project is an implementation of the paper - “Attention is all you need” (https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). We sought to apply the transformer model architecture introduced in this  paper to translate sentences from Hindi to English and vice-versa. Currently, we have achieved basic performance for this model and can translate most of the commonly used phrases and sentences. We chose this paper since it proved to be a breakthrough in the field of NLP and wanted to extend its functionality to machine translation.
